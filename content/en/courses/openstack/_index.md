# OpenStack with Chameleon Cloud

We have put together from the chameleon cloud manual a subset of
information that is useful for using OpenStack. This focusses mostly
on Virtual machine provisioning. The reason we put our own
documentation here is to promote more secure utilization of Chameleon
Cloud.

Additional material on how to uniformly access OpenStack via a multicloud command line tool is available at:

* https://cloudmesh.github.io/cloudmesh-manual/

We highly recommend you use the multicloud environment as it will
allow you also to access AWS, Azure, Google, and other clouds from the
same command line interface.


The Chameleon Cloud document is availanle as online book in ePub and PDF from the
following Web Page:
