* When working with books, ePubs typically display better than PDF.  For ePub, we recommend using iBooks on macOS and calibre on all
  other systems.

## Complementary material

This course does not require you to do much Linux, However if you do
need it, we recommend the following as starting point. The most
elementary Linux features can be learned in 12 hours. This includes
bash, editor, directory structure, managing files. Under Windows we
recommend you to use gitbash which is a terminal that has all the
command build in that you would need for elementary work.

## Contributions

You can contribute to the material with useful links and sections that
you find. Just make sure that you do not plagiarize when making
contributions. Please review our guide on plagiarizm.

## Computer Needs

This course does not require a sophisticated computer. Most of the
things can be done remotely. Even a Raspberry Pi with 4 or 8GB could
be used as a terminal to log into remote computers. This will cost you
betwene $50 - $100 dependent on which version and equipment. However,
in this class we will not teach you how to use or setup a Pi or other
computer. This is for you to do and find out.

In case you need to buy a new computer for school make sure the
computer is upgradable to 16GB of main memory. We do no longer
recommend using HDD's but use SSDs. Buy the fast ones, as not every
SSD is the same. Samsung is offering some under the EVO Pro
branding. Get as much memory as you can effort. In addition make sure
you back up your work. Either in an online storage such as
google, or an external drive.
