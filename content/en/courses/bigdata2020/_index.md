## CLass Material 

As part of this class we will be using a variety of sources. To
simplify the presentation we provide them in a variety of smaller
packaged material incluing books, lecture notes, slides, presentations
and code.

Note: We will update the course book about big data shortely.

For this class we use:

Additional information will be added and improved here.


* For ePub, we recommend using iBooks on macOS and calibre on all
  other systems.

## Computer Needs

This course does not require a sophisticated computer. Most of the
things can be done remotely. Even a Raspberry Pi with 4-8GB could be
used as a terminal to log into remote computers. This will cost you a
minimum of $50. However in this class we will not teach you how to use
or setup a Pi or other computer. This is for you to do.

In case you need to buy a new computer make sure the computer is
upgradable to 16G of main memory. We do no longer recommend using
HDD's but use SSDs. Buy the fast ones. Not every SSD is the
same. Samsung is offering some under the EVO Pro branding. Get as much
as you can effort. In addition make sure you back up your work. Either
in an online storage such as google, or an external drive.

## Complementary material

This course does not require you to do much Linux, However if you do
need it, we recommend the following as starting point. The most
elementary Linux featres can be
learned in 12 hours. This includes bash, editor, directory structure,
managing files. Under Windows we recommend you to use gitbash which is
a terminal that has all the command build in that you would need for
elementary work.
