This module covers 51 usecases of Big data that emerged from a NIST
(National Institute for Standards and Technology) study of Big
data. We cover the NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG)
Process and summarizes the work of five subgroups: Definitions and
Taxonomies Subgroup, Reference Architecture Subgroup, Security and
Privacy Subgroup, Technology Roadmap Subgroup and the Requirements
andUse Case Subgroup. 51 use cases collected in this process are
briefly discussed with a classification of the source of parallelism
and the high and low level computational structure. We describe the
key features of this classification.

Big Data Applications and Analytics Discovery of Higgs Boson Part I
(Unit 8) Section Units 9-11 Summary: This section starts by describing
the LHC accelerator at CERN and evidence found by the experiments
suggesting existence of a Higgs Boson. The huge number of authors on a
paper, remarks on histograms and Feynman diagrams is followed by an
accelerator picture gallery. The next unit is devoted to Python
experiments looking at histograms of Higgs Boson production with
various forms of shape of signal and various background and with
various event totals. Then random variables and some simple principles
of statistics are introduced with explanation as to why they are
relevant to Physics counting experiments. The unit introduces Gaussian
(normal) distributions and explains why they seen so often in natural
phenomena. Several Python illustrations are given. Random Numbers with
their Generators and Seeds lead to a discussion of Binomial and
Poisson Distribution. Monte-Carlo and accept-reject methods. The
Central Limit Theorem concludes discussion.

Sports sees significant growth in analytics with pervasive statistics
shifting to more sophisticated measures. We start with baseball as
game is built around segments dominated by individuals where detailed
(video/image) achievement measures including PITCHf/x and FIELDf/x are
moving field into big data arena. There are interesting relationships
between the economics of sports and big data analytics. We look at
Wearables and consumer sports/recreation. The importance of spatial
visualization is discussed. We look at other Sports: Soccer, Olympics,
NFL Football, Basketball, Tennis and Horse Racing.

>}}

Health and Medicine sector has become a much more needed service than
ever. With the uprising of the Covid-19, resource usage, monitoring,
research on anti-virals and many more challenging tasks were on the
shoulders of scientists. To face such challenges, AI can become a
worthy partner in solving some of the related problems efficiently and
effectively.

>}}

AI in banking has become a vital component in providing best services to the
peopel. AI provides securing bank transactions, providing suggestions and
many other services for the clients. And legacy banking systems are also being
reinforced with novel AI techniques to migrate business models with technology.

>}}

Transportation systems is a vital component in human life. With the dawn of AI,
transportation systems are also reinforced to provide better service for the people. 
Analyzing tera-bytes of data collected in day-to-day transportation activities are used
to analyze issues and provide a better experience for the user.

>}}

Energy is a term we find in everyday life. Conserving energy and smart usage is vital in managing energy demands. 
Here the role played by AI has become significant in recent years. 
Many efforts have been taken by industry leaders like Bill Gates to provide better solutions for efficient energy consumption. 
Apart from that Space explorations are also being reinforced with AI. Better communication, remote sensing, 
data analysis have become key components in succeeding the challenge to unravel the mysteries in the universe.

### Introduction to Linux

This course does not require you to do much Linux. However, if you do
need it, we recommend the following as starting point listed 

The most
elementary Linux features can be learned in 12 hours. This includes
bash, editor, directory structure, managing files. Under Windows, we
recommend using gitbash, a terminal with all the
commands built-in that you would need for elementary work.

## Contributions

You can contribute to the material with useful links and sections that
you find. Just make sure that you do not plagiarize when making
contributions. Please review our guide on plagiarism.

## Computer Needs

This course does not require a sophisticated computer. Most of the
things can be done remotely. Even a Raspberry Pi with 4 or 8GB could
be used as a terminal to log into remote computers. This will cost you
between $50 - $100 dependent on which version and equipment. However,
we will not teach you how to use or set up a Pi or another
computer in this class. This is for you to do and find out.

In case you need to buy a new computer for school, make sure the
computer is upgradable to 16GB of main memory. We do no longer
recommend using HDD's but use SSDs. Buy the fast ones, as not every
SSD is the same. Samsung is offering some under the EVO Pro
branding. Get as much memory as you can effort. Also, make sure
you back up your work regularly. Either in online storage such as
Google, or an external drive.
