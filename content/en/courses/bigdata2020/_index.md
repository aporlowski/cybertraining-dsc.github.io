## Class Material 

As part of this class, we will be using a variety of sources. To
simplify the presentation we provide them in a variety of smaller
packaged material including books, lecture notes, slides, presentations
and code.

Note: We will regularly update the course material, so please
always download the newest version. Some browsers try to
be fancy and cache previous page visits. So please make sure to
refresh the page.

We will use the following material:

## Big Data Usecases Survey

| --- |
|  [{{< figure src="/images/usecases.png" width="15%">}} This module covers 51 usecases of Big data that emerged from a NIST (National Institute for Standards and Technology) study of Big data. We cover the NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) Process and summarizes the work of five subgroups: Definitions and Taxonomies Subgroup, Reference Architecture Subgroup, Security and Privacy Subgroup, Technology Roadmap Subgroup and the Requirements andUse Case Subgroup. 51 use cases collected in this process are briefly discussed with a classification of the source of parallelism and the high and low level computational structure. We describe the key features of this classification.](/modules/bigdataapplications/2020/usecases)|

## Physics

|  [{{< figure src="/images/physics.png" width="15%">}} Big Data Applications and Analytics Discovery of Higgs Boson Part I (Unit 8) Section Units 9-11 Summary: This section starts by describing the LHC accelerator at CERN and evidence found by the experiments suggesting existence of a Higgs Boson. The huge number of authors on a paper, remarks on histograms and Feynman diagrams is followed by an accelerator picture gallery. The next unit is devoted to Python experiments looking at histograms of Higgs Boson production with various forms of shape of signal and various background and with various event totals. Then random variables and some simple principles of statistics are introduced with explanation as to why they are relevant to Physics counting experiments. The unit introduces Gaussian (normal) distributions and explains why they seen so often in natural phenomena. Several Python illustrations are given. Random Numbers with their Generators and Seeds lead to a discussion of Binomial and Poisson Distribution. Monte-Carlo and accept-reject methods. The Central Limit Theorem concludes discussion.](/modules/bigdataapplications/2020/physics)|

## Sports

|     |
| --- |
|  [{{< figure src="/images/sport.png" width="15%">}} Sports sees significant growth in analytics with pervasive statistics shifting to more sophisticated measures. We start with baseball as game is built around segments dominated by individuals where detailed (video/image) achievement measures including PITCHf/x and FIELDf/x are moving field into big data arena. There are interesting relationships between the economics of sports and big data analytics. We look at Wearables and consumer sports/recreation. The importance of spatial visualization is discussed. We look at other Sports: Soccer, Olympics, NFL Football, Basketball, Tennis and Horse Racing.](/modules/bigdataapplications/2020/sports)|

* When working with books, ePubs typically display better than PDF.  For ePub, we recommend using iBooks on macOS and calibre on all
  other systems.


### Introduction to Linux

This course does not require you to do much Linux. However, if you do
need it, we recommend the following as starting point listed 

The most
elementary Linux features can be learned in 12 hours. This includes
bash, editor, directory structure, managing files. Under Windows, we
recommend using gitbash, a terminal with all the
commands built-in that you would need for elementary work.

## Contributions

You can contribute to the material with useful links and sections that
you find. Just make sure that you do not plagiarize when making
contributions. Please review our guide on plagiarism.

## Computer Needs

This course does not require a sophisticated computer. Most of the
things can be done remotely. Even a Raspberry Pi with 4 or 8GB could
be used as a terminal to log into remote computers. This will cost you
between $50 - $100 dependent on which version and equipment. However,
we will not teach you how to use or set up a Pi or another
computer in this class. This is for you to do and find out.

In case you need to buy a new computer for school, make sure the
computer is upgradable to 16GB of main memory. We do no longer
recommend using HDD's but use SSDs. Buy the fast ones, as not every
SSD is the same. Samsung is offering some under the EVO Pro
branding. Get as much memory as you can effort. Also, make sure
you back up your work regularly. Either in online storage such as
Google, or an external drive.
