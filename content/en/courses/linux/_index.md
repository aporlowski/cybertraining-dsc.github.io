Linux will be used on many computers to develop and interact with cloud services. Especially popular are the command line tools that even exist on Windows. Thus we can have a uniform environment on all platforms using the bash shell.

# OpenStack with Chameleon Cloud

We have put together from the chameleon cloud manual a subset of
useful information for using OpenStack. This focusses mostly
on Virtual machine provisioning. The reason we put our 
documentation here is to promote more secure utilization of Chameleon
Cloud.

Additional material on how to uniformly access OpenStack via a multicloud command line tool is available at:

* https://cloudmesh.github.io/cloudmesh-manual/

We highly recommend you use the multicloud environment as it will
allow you also to access AWS, Azure, Google, and other clouds from the
same command line interface.


The Chameleon Cloud document is availanle as online book in ePub and PDF from the
following Web Page:

For ePub, we recommend using iBooks on MacOS and calibre on all other systems.

* Linux SHell
* Perl one liners
* Refcards
* SSH
  * keygen
