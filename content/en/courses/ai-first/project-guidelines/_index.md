All students of this class are doing a software project.

- The final project is 40-50% of grade (depending on the number of
  homework assignments that are set)

- All projects must have a well-written report and may have a software
  component
    
- We must be able to run software from class GitHub repository. To do so you must include an appendix to your project 
  report describing how to run your project.
    
  * If you use containers you must decsribe how to create them from Docker files.
  * If you usue ipy nptebooks you must include a button or links so it can be run in collab
    

- There are a useful set of example projects submitted in previous
  classes

- In this class you do not have the option to work on a joint report, however you can collaborate. 

- Note: all reports and projects are open for everyone as they are open source.

# Details 

The major deliverable of the course is a software project with a report. The
project must include a programming part to get a full grade. It is
expected that you identify a suitable analysis task and data set for the
project and that you learn how to apply this analysis as well as to
motivate it. It is part of the learning outcome that you determine this
instead of us giving you a topic.

It is desired that the project has a novel feature in it. A project
that you simply reproduce may not recieve the best grade, but this depends 
on what the analysis is and how you report it.

One goal of the class is to use open source technology wherever
possible. As a beneficial side product of this, we are able to
distribute all previous reports that use such technologies. This means
you can cite your own work, for example, in your resume. 
For big data, we have more than 1000 data sets we point to.

**Comments on Example Projects**

Warning: Please note that we do not make any quality assumptions to the
published papers that we list here. It is up to you to identify
outstanding papers.

Warning: Also note that these activities took place in previous classes,
and the content of this class has since been updated or the focus has shifted. 
Especially  chapters on Google Colab, AI, DL have been added to the course after the
date of most projects. Also, some of the documents include an additional
assignment called Technology review. These are not the same as the
Project report or review we refer to here. These are just assignments
done in 2-3 weeks. So please do not use them to identify a comparison
with your own work. The activities we ask from you are substantially
more involved than the technology reviews.

# Format 

Plagiarism is of course not permitted. It is your responsibility 
to know what plagiarism is. We provide a detailed book about it, you can also do the IU 
plagiarism test to learn more.

All project reports must be provided in github.com as a markdown file.
All images must be in an images directory. You must use proper
citations. Images copied from the Internet must have a citation in the
Image caption. Please use the IEEE citation format and do not use 
APA or harvard style. Simply use fotnotes in markdown but treat them as 
regular citations and not text footnotes (e.g. adhere to the IEEE rules).  
All projects and reports must
be checked into the Github repository. Please take a look at the example we created for you.

The report will be stored in the github.com.

> ./project/index.md
> ./project/images/mysampleimage.png


**Length of Project Report**

Software Project Reports: 2500 - 3000 Words.

# FAQ

-   I like to do a project that relates to my company?

    -   Please go ahead and do so but make sure you use open-source
        data, and all results can be shared with everyone. If that is
        not the case, please pick a different project.

-   Can I use Word or Google doc, or LaTeX to hand in the final
    document?

    -   No. you must use github.com and markdown.

    -   Please note that exporting documents from word or google docs
        can result in a markdown file that needs substantial cleanup.
        
-   Where do I find more information about markdown

    -   [[https://cloudmesh-community.github.io/pub/vonLaszewski-writing.pdf]{.ul}](https://cloudmesh-community.github.io/pub/vonLaszewski-writing.pdf)

-   Can I use an online markdown editor?

    -   There are many online markdown editors available. One of them is
        [[https://dillinger.io/]{.ul}](https://dillinger.io/).\
        Use them to write your document or check the one you have
        developed in another editor such as word or google docs. Just
        paste and copy ;-)

    -   Remember, online editors can be dangerous in case you lose
        network connection. So we recommend to develop small portions
        and copy them into a locally managed document that you then
        check into github.com.

    -   Github GUI (recommended): this works very well, but the
        markdown is slightly limited. We use hugo's markdown.
        
    -   pyCharm (recommended): works very well. 
    
    -   emacs (recommended): works very well

-   What level of expertise and effort do I need to write markdown?

    -   We taught 10-year-old students to use markdown in less than 5
        minutes.

-   What level of expertise is needed to learn BibTeX

    -   We have taught BibTeX to inexperienced students while using
        jabref in less than an hour (but it is not required for this
        course). You can use footnotes while making sure that the
        footnotes follow the IEEE format.

-   How can I get IEEE formatted footnotes?

    -   Simply use jabref and paste and copy the text it produces.

-   Will there be more FAQ's?

    -   Please see our book on markdown.

    -   Discuss your issue in piazza; if it is an issue that is not yet
        covered, we will add it to the book.

-   How do I write URLs?

    -   Answered in book

    -   Note: All URL's must be either in \[TEXT\](URLHERE) or
        \<URLHERE\> format.
