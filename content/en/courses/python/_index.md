Python is an easy to learn programming language. It has efficient
high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to
object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s simple syntax and dynamic
typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal
language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas
on most platforms.
