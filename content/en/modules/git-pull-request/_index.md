It is very easy to help us modifying the Web Site through
GitHub pull requests. We demonstrate this via the command line and 
the GitHub GUI.

The command line can be run from any computer with Linux, Windows, and
macOS. On Windows, you need to install gitbash and use that. This way, you have a command line terminal that works the same on Linux and OSX.

Please note that we have two different mechanisms:

1. A pull request via the command line, in which we also demonstrate how easy it is to see your changes in realtime

2. A pull request via the GitHub GUI

We are not explaining how to keep up with the original forked repository.
