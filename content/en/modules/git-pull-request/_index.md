It is actually very easy to help us modifying the Web Site through
GitHub pull requests. We demonstrate this via the commandline and via
the GitHub GUI.

The commandline can be run form any computer with Linux, Windows, and
macOS. ON Windows you need to install gitbash and use that. This way
you have a commandline terminal that just works like on LInux and OSX.

Please note that we have two different mechanisms

1. A pull request via the commandline, in which we also demonstrate how easy it is to see your changes in realtime

2. A pull request via the github GUI

We are not explaining how to keep up with the original forked repository.
