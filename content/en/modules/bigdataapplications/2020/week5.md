# Physics with Big Data Applications

E534 2019 Big Data Applications and Analytics Discovery of Higgs Boson
Part I (Unit 8) Section Units 9-11 Summary: This section starts by
describing the LHC accelerator at CERN and evidence found by the
experiments suggesting existence of a Higgs Boson. The huge number of
authors on a paper, remarks on histograms and Feynman diagrams is
followed by an accelerator picture gallery. The next unit is devoted
to Python experiments looking at histograms of Higgs Boson production
with various forms of shape of signal and various background and with
various event totals. Then random variables and some simple principles
of statistics are introduced with explanation as to why they are
relevant to Physics counting experiments. The unit introduces Gaussian
(normal) distributions and explains why they seen so often in natural
phenomena. Several Python illustrations are given. Random Numbers with
their Generators and Seeds lead to a discussion of Binomial and
Poisson Distribution. Monte-Carlo and accept-reject methods.  The
Central Limit Theorem concludes discussion.

## Unit 8:

### 8.1 - Looking for Higgs: 1. Particle and Counting Introduction 1

We return to particle case with slides used in introduction and stress
that particles often manifested as bumps in histograms and those bumps
need to be large enough to stand out from background in a
statistically significant fashion.

### 8.2 - Looking for Higgs: 2. Particle and Counting Introduction 2

We give a few details on one LHC experiment ATLAS. Experimental
physics papers have a staggering number of authors and quite big
budgets. Feynman diagrams describe processes in a fundamental fashion.

budgets. Feynman diagrams describe processes in a fundamental fashion

### 8.4 - Looking for Higgs:  4. Accelerator Picture Gallery of Big Science

This lesson gives a small picture gallery of accelerators. Accelerators, detection chambers and magnets in tunnels and a large underground laboratory used fpr experiments where you need to be shielded from background like cosmic rays.

## Unit 9

This unit is devoted to Python experiments with Geoffrey looking at 
histograms of Higgs Boson production with various forms of shape of 
signal and various background and with various event totals


### 9.1 - Looking for Higgs II: 1: Class Software 

We discuss how this unit uses Java (deprecated) and Python on both a backend server
(FutureGrid - closed!) or a local client. We point out useful book on
Python for data analysis. This lesson is deprecated. Follow current
technology for class

### 9.2 - Looking for Higgs II: 2: Event Counting 

We define ''event counting'' data collection environments. We discuss the python and Java
code to generate events according to a particular scenario (the
important idea of Monte Carlo data). Here a sloping background plus
either a Higgs particle generated similarly to LHC observation or one
observed with better resolution (smaller measurement error).

### 9.3 - Looking for Higgs II: 3: With Python examples of Signal plus Background 

This uses Monte Carlo data both to generate data like the
experimental observations and explore effect of changing amount of data
and changing measurement resolution for Higgs.

### 9.4 - Looking for Higgs II: 4: Change shape of background & number of Higgs Particles 

This lesson continues the examination of Monte Carlo
data looking at effect of change in number of Higgs particles produced
and in change in shape of background

### 10.1 - Statistics Overview and Fundamental Idea: Random Variables 

We go through the many different areas of statistics covered in the Physics
unit. We define the statistics concept of a random variable.

### 10.2 - Physics and Random Variables I

We describe the DIKW pipeline for the analysis of this type of physics experiment 
and go through details of analysis pipeline for the LHC ATLAS experiment. 
We give examples of event displays showing the final state particles 
seen in a few events. We illustrate how physicists decide whats going 
on with a plot of expected Higgs production experimental cross sections 
(probabilities) for signal and background.

### 10.4 - Statistics of Events with Normal Distributions

We introduce Poisson and Binomial distributions and define independent 
identically distributed (IID) random variables. We give the law of 
large numbers defining the errors in counting and leading to Gaussian 
distributions for many things. We demonstrate this in Python experiments.

### 10.5 - Gaussian Distributions

We introduce the Gaussian distribution and give Python examples of the 
fluctuations in counting Gaussian distributions.

### 10.6 - Using Statistics

We discuss the significance of a standard deviation and role of biases 
and insufficient statistics with a Python example in getting incorrect answers.
