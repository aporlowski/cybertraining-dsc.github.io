## Transportation Systems Summary

1. The ride-hailing industry highlights the growth of a new “Transportation System” TS
  a. For ride-hailing TS controls rides matching drivers and customers; it predicts how to position cars and how to avoid traffic slowdowns
  b. However, TS is much bigger outside ride-hailing as we move into the “connected vehicle” era
  c. TS will probably find autonomous vehicles easier to deal with than human drivers
2. Cloud Fog and Edge components
3. Autonomous AI was centered on generalized image processing
4. TS also needs AI (and DL) but this is for routing and geospatial time-series; different technologies from those for image processing
