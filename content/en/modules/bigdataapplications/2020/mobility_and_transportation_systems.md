## Overview

1. Industry being transformed by a)  Autonomy (AI) and b) Electric power
2. Established Organizations can’t change
    - General Motors (employees: 225,000 in 2016 to around 180,000 in 2018) finds it hard to compete with Tesla (42000 employees)
    - Market value GM was half the market value of Tesla at the start of 2020 but is now just 11% October 2020
    - GM purchased Cruise to compete
    - Funding and then buying startups is an important “transformation” strategy
3. Autonomy needs Sensors Computers Algorithms and Software
    - Also experience (training data)
    - Algorithms main bottleneck; others will automatically improve although lots of interesting work in new sensors, computers and software
    - Over the last 3 years, electrical power has gone from interesting to “bound to happen”; Tesla’s happy customers probably contribute to this
    - Batteries and Charging stations needed
