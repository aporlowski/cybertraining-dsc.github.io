Chose an area where Big Data (and AI) is radically changing the operation of that industry.  
Chose an area where either the area or its change is most interesting to you so I can learn what interests you

Describe existing example(s) of this changed operation
If possible describe a way that an operation in your chosen area could be changed by Big Data/AI  in the future but this does not seem to be happening now 

This report should be 1.5-3 pages. Cite all web quotes. Font 11 or 12; Spacing 1 or 1.15; illustrations can be in the report
