### Overview

This Lecture is recorded in 8 parts and gives an introduction and motivation for the class. This and other lectures in class are divided into "bite-sized lessons" from 5 to 30 minutes in length; that's why it has 8 parts. 

Lecture explains what students might gain from the class even if they end up with different types of jobs from data engineering, software engineering, data science or a business (application) expert. It stresses that we are well into a transformation that impacts industry research and the way life is lived. This transformation is centered on using the digital way with clouds, edge computing and deep learning giving the implementation. This "AI-Driven Digital Transformation" is as transformational as the Industrial Revolution in the past. We note that deep learning dominates most innovative AI replacing several traditional machine learning methods.

The slides for this course can be found at [E534-Fall2020-Introduction](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ztKIAb6GaIcaOtiyWEHuRdR9z2xPyucgbhw-EpiDIRI/edit#slide=id.g94cec20bdc_0_240)

### A: Getting Started: BDAA Course Introduction Part A: Big Data Applications and Analytics 

This lesson describes briefly the trends driving and consequent of the AI-Driven Digital Transformation. It discusses the organizational aspects of the class and notes the two driving trends are clouds and AI. Clouds are mature and a dominant presence. AI is still rapidly changing and we can expect further major changes. The edge (devices and associated local fog computing) has always been important but now more is being done there.

### B: Technology Futures from Gartner's Analysis: BDAA Course Introduction Part B: Big Data Applications and Analytics 

This lesson goes through the technologies (AI Edge Cloud) from 2008-2020 that are driving the AI-Driven Digital Transformation. we use Hype Cycles and Priority Matrices from Gartner tracking importance concepts from the Innovation Trigger, Peak of Inflated Expectations through the Plateau of Productivity. We contrast clouds and AI.
