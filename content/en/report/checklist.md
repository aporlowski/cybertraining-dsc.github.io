# Project Checklist

Reminder: Project updates
This is a reminder that you submit your project updates today for the week, if you have not yet done so. Here is where you shoudl be this week:

a) finalized your project topic

b) follow our template we clearly posted

c) have meaningful content in your report

d) have a background section with comparable efforts to yours

e) have a reference section using footnote style references just as we show in our template. Make sure the references relate to your project. Each reference must be cited in the text,

f) If you use figures, check carefully with our template, do not invent your own method, like we have seen some students do as they did not look at our template.. If you see we can do things better, in the template, let us know and we update it.

d) have started the python program or notebook

e) check if your report is listed at https://cybertraining-dsc.github.io/report/ and click on your paper link, your student link, and your edit link, to make sure they all work properly. If not please correct them via a pull request (you can edit that page and see how we do it for other students). From now on the content changes to this page are managed via pull requests by you. (Click Edit this page). It will take at least a day till they are integrated, so if you see a mistake do it ASAP.

When checking in your program, please add a "download" data function and do not check in the data if the data is large or

Please view a previous post we send out with the pseudo code to download the data if it does not yet exist.

If your data is too big contact us via piazza so we can discuss how to upload.

When uploading a notebook, please reset it so that no cached data is stored in github.

You can create png files of graphics so you can include them in your project.md

Most of this  was already tasks for last week so we kindly make sure that those  that did not yet do it to complete this for this week.

Also we like to remind you to plan for a significant time on your projects every week, as the weekly contribution will be included in your grade. This also avoids that you underestimate the effort in this class and wrongly assess that you can afford to work konly on other classes during the week. Please note that if you are not working weekly on this project it will be very difficult for you to achieve your best. That is why we remind you.

PS: please remember that those writing a report only with no programming must have significant more high quality content. We guess that you  should have by now 1600 words or more. You may want to check this and verify what 1600 words mean so you can plan your next steps.

i) Proper citations @270

j) links to your python scripts in your report and description of what it does 

k) images that demonstrate what your script does

l) improve the report

m) have the background section completed

n) check if you have updated your README.yaml. see 

https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-312/ for an example. Make sure once you added the information, the links work. If you use a report only you need to change the filename to report instead of project.

o) include in your python program the cloudmesh benchmark with StopWatch that we presented in class 


Tip: Citations are before the dot
We apologize to those that do it correct, but we see that some students simply do not follow our template or start modifying it. Thus we find it easier to remind the class once more.

----------------------------------------------

When you use the citations you MUST for us do them before the dot that closes the sentence that you cite in or refer to.

Although we use footnotes in markdown we will use the propper IEEE format style for citations. They do require you do the [^1] before the dot

wrong: This is a sentence with refernce.[^1]

correct: This is a sentence with reference [^1].

wrong: Simon says "Hallo".[^1]

Also at the end of your paper in the reference list, there is no space before the :

## 8. Refernces

Please do not invent your own format. It is far simpler to just follow our template. This will guarantee a uniform look and allow us to easier parse your paper.
